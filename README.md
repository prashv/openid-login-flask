# openid-login-flask
Flask Framework needs to be putup seperately
To handle our web forms we are going to use the Flask-WTF extension, 
which in turn wraps the WTForms project in a way that integrates nicely with Flask apps.

The structure of the flask virtual environment shall be :

openid-login-flask\
      flask\
        <virtual environment files>
      app\
        static\
        templates\
        __init__.py
        views.py
      tmp\
      run.py
